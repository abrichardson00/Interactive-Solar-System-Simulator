# Interactive-Solar-System-Simulator
Interactive web page which simulates planets / moons in the solar system, using a 4th order Runge-Kutta method.

Right click and drag to create a new celestial body. The scale can be adjusted from 'real-life' scale to a more visable alternative.

I'm in the process of making an option to focus the camera on a selected body. After sorting that out I want to load in some dataset of all (fairly large) objects in solar system, and see how well everything works.
